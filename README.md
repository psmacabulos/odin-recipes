This webpage is the first assignment on "The Odin Project" to test and apply my knowledge on HTML

Basic tags that are expected to be used are the following:

✔ Heading Tags 
✔ Paragraph Tags 
✔ Anchor Tags 
✔ Image Tag
✔ List Tags 

I also used the most basic html boiler plate to start with.
