  <h3 class="desc">Description</h3>
  <p class="desc">
    Sinigang is a Filipino soup cooked with pork. Serve with rice and for
    additional sauce, use soy or fish sauce. If you want to, you can add what
    Filipinos call gabi gabi, which is a small taro root. When peeled they
    look like potatoes.
  </p>
  <p class="desc">
    You can add five to six of them when you add the water and make sure they
    are cooked through. Take them out when they are cooked because they can
    get too soft.
  </p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul class="ingredients">
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, chopped</li>
    <li>2 plum tomatoes, cut into 1/2-inch dice</li>
    <li>1 pound bone-in pork chops</li>
    <li>4 cups water, more if needed</li>
    <li>1 (1.41 ounce) package tamarind soup base (such as Knorr®)</li>
    <li>½ pound fresh green beans, trimmed</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol class="steps">
    <li>
      Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add onion; cook and
      stir until softened and translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with salt.
    </li>
    <li>
      Stir in ginger, tomatoes, and pork chops. Cover and reduce heat to
      medium-low. Turn the pork occasionally, until browned.

      Pour in water and tamarind soup base. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat
      and simmer until the pork is tender and cooked through, about 30
